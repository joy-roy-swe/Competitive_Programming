## Question

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

### Example 1:
Input : consider the square matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
Output : 2
Explanation :
    The left-to-right diagonal sums up to 1 + 5 + 9 = 15.
    The right-to-left diagonal sums up to 3 + 5 + 9 = 17.
    Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.
